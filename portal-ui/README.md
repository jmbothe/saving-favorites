### Proposed Solution and Technical Requirements

## Install and Testdrive

This project depends upon [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Make sure you have all of these dependencies installed before you proceed.

1. [Clone this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to your machine.
2. In a terminal window, from the top-level project directory run `docker-compose up`.
3. Once all of the containers are up and running (wait a minute or two, especially if this is the first time you've docker'd up), navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and enjoy the app!
4. When you are finished testdriving the app, in the terminal `ctrl + C` to stop the docker images, and then run `docker-compose down` to remove the mounted docker images.
